# Minesweeper
A small project i made as a mid-term project (but i didn't submit this ;_;). It doesn't work very well but still my great creation !

## Bugs been fixed:
Ram consumption.

Can't remove flags.

Overflow.

## Feature update:

First move always opens a cell no matter it is right, left or middle click.

### Small note:
```The code isn't optimal, might eat your ram during launch lmao. I can fix that but too lazy ðŸ˜¬```
